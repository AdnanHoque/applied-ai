### Applied AI repo
For experiments and research on applied AI.

### Projects

#### Kernels

Housing a variety of Triton and CUDA kernels for training and inference.

Inference kernels = no backward pass support.

##### Triton Kernels

1 - Triton - MoE (Mixtral) GEMM for accelerating inference. Uses col major access pattern to increase locality.

2 - Triton - Fused Softmax for both training and inference.
